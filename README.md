Project Name: Advice Generator React Build 
Description: Made an advice generator using the assist givin to me in React. Not sure whats causing the 2 second delay. I threw my api fetch into a seperate folder to see if that worked but to no avail so just kept as is.
Peer Review: Hassan - Looks accurate to the design provided and the website works, would just fix a slight bug that makes it click two times for the advice to change. Other than that, good job.
